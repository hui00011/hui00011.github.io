            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is HUI JIE. I am a new <em>international student</em> major in <abbr titile="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> from 
                Shanghai of China. So this is my 1<sup>st</sup> semester. Because of the Covid-19, we have the remote learning style. 
                I still in China now and have twelve hours time difference. 
                But I think I will move to Ottawa this year. 
            </p>

                Traveling is my biggest interest, and it is also my biggest consumption expenditure. 
                It allows me to see the beautiful scenery and customs of various places, increase knowledge and broaden horizons. 
                Put aside the pressure of work and fully release myself. 
                Before the epidemic, I also have been to many countries, such as Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, 
                the United States, Spain, Portugal, etc. In daily life, all kinds of sport and being with family and friends 
                are my greatest pleasures. <blockquote>Time is like surging rapids, it also did not want to <cite>- Cervantes</cite>

                So we cherish our time, do what we love, and enjoy life.
            </P2>
